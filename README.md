## 📁 The Repository

This repository contains an automated script that clones my
[.files repo](https://github.com/david35mm/.files) and applies a few additional
system tweaks.

At the moment, the script supports Fedora and **vanilla** Arch Linux. Adding
support for other distributions should not be too difficult, so pull requests
are very welcome.

## 🚀 How to run the script?

If you already know what dotfiles are, great. If not, you can read a quick
explanation [here](https://github.com/david35mm/.files#the-repository).

In addition to cloning my [.files repo](https://github.com/david35mm/.files),
this script can apply a few extras, including:

- improved DNF/Pacman configuration and aliases
- automatic networking setup
- installation of a few window managers
- the software selection I use (this may change in the future)

To run the script on your system, <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd> the following command into your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david35mm/up35mm/main/up35mm.sh | sh
```

## 👋 Who is David Andrés?

I started out studying Electronic Engineering, but I am now doing Computer Science. I am especially interested in free and open-source software. I was born in [Bogotá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1), the capital city of [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia). Since starting my undergraduate degree at the [National University of Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Colombia), I have been living in [Manizales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manizales).

Photography has been one of my main hobbies over the past few years, and I also run a [small YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8MDD0AHj0-ZUPolunq6MQ) where I share tips and explain photography concepts. All the videos are in Spanish.

The “35mm” in my nickname comes from the classic photographic film format. I also have [my own portfolio](https://david35mm.com/tags/carrete/) — I mainly focus on portrait photography.

As for GNU/Linux, I have been using Fedora (stable branch) for the past few years, although I am still tempted to give Rawhide a go. Throughout most of 2021, I used Artix Linux (with s6 init). Feel free to DM me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/david35mm.co) if you would like to chat (or practise your Spanish).
